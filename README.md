# Multimodal-ML-Housing-Price-Prediction-Using-Images-Tabular-Data-  
Objective:   
Predict housing prices using both structured data and house images.   
Dataset:   
Housing Sales Dataset + Custom Image Dataset (your own or any public source) 
Instructions:   
● Use CNNs to extract features from images   
● Combine extracted image features with tabular data   
● Train a model using both modalities   
● Evaluate performance using MAE and RMSE   
Skills Gained:   
● Multimodal machine learning   
● Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)   
● Feature fusion (image + tabular)   
● Regression modeling and evaluation
